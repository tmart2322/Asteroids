# Asteroids
Final project for Java class in high school

Android SDK and LibGDX 1.0 are required to run this project. This was developed in Netbeans and the instructions will therefore be made for the Netbeans IDE.

Here are instructions on downloading Android SDK and setting it up for the Netbeans IDE: https://bitbucket.org/nbandroid/nbandroid/wiki/Installation#markdown-header-android-sdk-location

After you instal Android SDK, you will want to download LibGDX 1.0.0 which can be found here: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/releases
When you open the project it will show you the missing libraries libraries for the project (both of which can are downloaded in the folder above). Add these libraries and the application should launch.
